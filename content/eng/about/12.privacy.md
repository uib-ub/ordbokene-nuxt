## Cookies
For technical reasons, ordbokene.no uses cookies to manage settings and choice of display language. These cookies are not used to identify you or log your activity. Cookies are only added if you actively use the following functionality:

## Usage Statistics
Search terms are logged on the server without the use of cookies, but this is only used to create search statistics. We use an Nginx web server where logs are overwritten after a while, so IP addresses are not permanently stored anywhere. We also log the usage of certain features on the website with plausible.io, which does not store IP addresses or other information that can link usage statistics to specific users.
