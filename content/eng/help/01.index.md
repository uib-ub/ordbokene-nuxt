# Help
You can view the contents of the dictionaries in three ways: regular search, article lookup, and advanced search. In a regular search, you will be redirected to the entry if the only result is an inflected form of that word. If you have multiple results in inflected forms, you can see them in a list with links. You can compare two search terms by using the character <kbd>|</kbd>. If you compare more than two words or use wildcard characters, you will be directed to advanced search. [Learn more about advanced search here](/eng/help/advanced).

Each entry in the dictionaries with a specific meaning is called an "article." The complete articles are displayed as search results in regular and advanced searches unless you have [enabled list view in settings](/eng/settings).
If you want to view an article by itself, without the other meanings of the search term, you can click "article page" at the bottom right of the article boxes. If you click "copy link" or "share," you will also receive a link to the article page, not to your search.

Under the search results, you will find not only links to hits in inflected forms but also to similar search terms and possible translations between Nynorsk and Bokm√•l.
