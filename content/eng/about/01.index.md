# About
This is a test version of an upcoming upgrade to the website for the standard dictionaries _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_. The site has better accessibility features than the first version of ordbokene.no, and it includes some new functionality. _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are two independent, monolingual dictionaries, but in this test version, we have expanded the search suggestions with translations between Bokmål and Nynorsk based on the word list [_Administrativ ordliste_](https://xn--sprkrdet-c0ac.no/sprakhjelp/Skriverad/Nynorskhjelp/administrativ-ordliste/) from the Language Council of Norway and the machine translation platform Apertium. There may be errors and omissions in the new solution that we haven't discovered yet or haven't had time to correct.

_Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are jointly owned by [The Language Council of Norway](https://www.sprakradet.no/) and the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en). Since 2016, the editorial work on the standard dictionaries has been carried out at the University of Bergen, with several departments involved. [The Norwegian Language Collections](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/spesial/161345/about-norwegian-language-collections) manage the dictionaries and the source material on which they are based. The lexicographers are employed at the [Department of Linguistic, Literary, and Aesthetic Studies](https://www.uib.no/en/lle), and the computer technical work takes place at the [IT division](https://www.uib.no/en/it) and the Norwegian Language Collections at the University Library.

The process of revising the content of the dictionaries is ongoing, and the lexicographers regularly publish new and revised word entries. You can read more about this work on [the website of the revision project](https://www.uib.no/lle/revisjonsprosjektet) (only in Norwegian). The role of the Language Council is to ensure the quality of the articles and to determine how words should be written and inflected in Bokmål and Nynorsk. _Bokmålsordboka_ and _Nynorskordboka_ are continuously updated in accordance with the official orthography as prescribed by the Language Council, making them the authoritative source for the current and complete spelling in Bokmål and Nynorsk.
